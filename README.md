Exploratory data analysis of the Titanic dataset using Python, Pandas, and Seaborn.
# Titanic Survival Analysis (Python)

## Project Overview

This project explores the Titanic passenger dataset using Python.
The goal is to analyze survival patterns and identify the factors that influenced survival rates.

## Tools Used

* Python
* Pandas
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
* Jupyter Notebook

## Key Questions

* What was the overall survival rate?
* Did gender affect survival?
* Did passenger class influence survival?
* What was the age distribution of passengers?

## Key Findings

* Overall survival rate was approximately **38%**.
* **Females had a much higher survival rate** than males.
* **First-class passengers** had significantly better survival chances.
* Most passengers were between **20–40 years old**.
